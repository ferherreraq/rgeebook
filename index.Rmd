# Welcome {-}

<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgee/index.html"><img src="cover_rgeebook.png" width="250" height="400" class="cover" alt="cran's link" /></a>  __"[rgee](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgee/index.html)"__ is a binding package for calling Google Earth Engine API from within R. Additionally, several functions have been implemented to make simple the connection with the R spatial ecosystem.

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that allows users to have an easy access to a petabyte-scale archive of remote sensing data and run geospatial analysis on Google's infrastructure. Currently, Google offers support only for Python and JavaScript. rgee will fill the gap starting to provide support to R!.
